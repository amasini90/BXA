  abstract = {Context. Aims: Active galactic nuclei are known to have complex X-ray
	spectra that depend on both the properties of the accreting super-massive
	black hole (e.g. mass, accretion rate) and the distribution of obscuring
	material in its vicinity (i.e. the "torus"). Often however, simple
	and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the X-ray spectra
	of AGN, which do not capture the complexity and diversity of the
	observations. In the case of blank field surveys in particular, this
	should have an impact on e.g. the determination of the AGN luminosity
	function, the inferred accretion history of the Universe and also
	on our understanding of the relation between AGN and their host galaxies.
	Methods: We develop a Bayesian framework for model comparison and
	parameter estimation of X-ray spectra. We take into account uncertainties
	associated with both the Poisson nature of X-ray data and the determination
	of source redshift using photometric methods. We also demonstrate
	how Bayesian model comparison can be used to select among ten different
	physically motivated X-ray spectral models the one that provides
	a better representation of the observations. This methodology is
	applied to X-ray AGN in the 4 Ms Chandra Deep Field South. Results:
	For the ~350 AGN in that field, our analysis identifies four components
	needed to represent the diversity of the observed X-ray spectra:
	(1) an intrinsic power law; (2) a cold obscurer which reprocesses
	the radiation due to photo-electric absorption, Compton scattering
	and Fe-K fluorescence; (3) an unabsorbed power law associated with
	Thomson scattering off ionised clouds; and (4) Compton reflection,
	most noticeable from a stronger-than-expected Fe-K line. Simpler
	models, such as a photo-electrically absorbed power law with a Thomson
	scattering component, are ruled out with decisive evidence (B > 100).
	We also find that ignoring the Thomson scattering component results
	in underestimation of the inferred column density, NH, of the obscurer.
	Regarding the geometry of the obscurer, there is strong evidence
	against both a completely closed (e.g. sphere), or entirely open
	(e.g. blob of material along the line of sight), toroidal geometry
	in favour of an intermediate case. Conclusions: Despite the use of
	low-count spectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences
	on the geometry of the torus. Simpler models are ruled out in favour
	of a geometrically extended structure with significant Compton scattering.
	We confirm the presence of a soft component, possibly associated
	with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds in the opening angle of
	the torus. The additional Compton reflection required by data over
	that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a sign of a density
	gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk. Finally,
	we release a catalogue of AGN in the CDFS with estimated parameters
	such as the accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV band and the column
	density, NH, of the obscurer. Appendices and Figs. 6, 9-11 are available
